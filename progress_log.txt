I have created three classes "Tile", "Subarea" and "Puzzleboard" according to the initial plan. Unfortunately,
I haven't spent enough time to implement all the methods in Puzzleboard-class. Right now, I don't have any
unit tests, but I want to add them as soon as possible. I also created a Main-object in GUI, but it shows only a black
screen right now. I spent about 2 hours on this project. Now, I'm a bit late from my initial time plan,
because of the other courses.

I have almost done the basic version of the GUI window, but it still needs some improvements. I have
to add the feature, which will show the user possible candidates, once she/he will click on the tile. I also
made small changes in the backend of my program and I'm planning to continue implementing it as soon as the
GUI looks better. I think I have spent about 8 hours in the past two weeks.
