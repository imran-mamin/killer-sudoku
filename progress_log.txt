I have created three classes "Tile", "Subarea" and "Puzzleboard" according to the initial plan. Unfortunately,
I haven't spent enough time to implement all the methods in Puzzleboard-class. Right now, I don't have any
unit tests, but I want to add them as soon as possible. I also created a Main-object in GUI, but it shows only a black
screen right now. I spent about 2 hours on this project. Now, I'm a bit late from my initial time plan,
because of the other courses.
